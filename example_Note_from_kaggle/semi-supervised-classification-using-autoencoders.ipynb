Broadly, their exists three different machine learning processes: \n","\n","**1. Supervised Learning** is a process of training a machine learning model on a labelled dataset ie. a dataset in which the target variable is known. In this technique, the model aims to find the relationships among the independent and dependent variable. Examples of supervised learning are classification, regression and forecasting. \n","\n","**2. Unsupervised Learning** is a process of training a machine learning model on a dataset in which target variable is not known. In this technique, the model aims to find the most relevant patterns in the data or the segments of data. Examples of unsupervised learning are clustering, segmentations, dimensionality reduction etc. \n","\n","**3. Semi-Supervised Learning** is combination of supervised and unsupervised learning processes in which the unlabelled data is used for training a model as well. In this approach, the properties of unspervised learning are used to learn the best possible representation of data and the properties of supervised learning are used to learn the relationships in the representations which are then used to make predictions. \n","\n","<p align=\"center\">In this kernel, I have explained how to perform classification task using semi supervised learning approach. This approach makes use of autoencoders to learn the representation of the data then a simple linear classifier is trained to classify the dataset into respective classes.  \n"," \n","<br>\n","<h1 align=\"center\">Fraud Detection using Semi Supervised Learning</h1>  \n","\n","I am using the dataset of [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) by ULB machine learning group. Later, I am also applying the same technique on [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset. A number of kagglers have shared different approaches such as dataset balancing, anomaly detection, boosting models, deep learning etc but this approach is different. \n","\n","### Contents \n","\n","1.

An autoencoder is a regression task where the network is asked to predict its input (in other words, model the identity function).
